# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository" or "+"
3. Repository name: `staff-management-system` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `AI-Powered Staff Management System with Google Gemini Integration`
5. Set to Public or Private (your choice)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Step 3: Verify Upload
- Go to your GitHub repository page
- You should see all your project files
- The README.md should display the project information

## Important Notes
- Your .env file is already in .gitignore, so API keys won't be uploaded
- The project is ready for deployment on Vercel or other platforms
- Make sure to set environment variables in your deployment platform

## Next Steps
- Set up Vercel deployment using the GitHub repository
- Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Your project will be live and accessible via Vercel URL
